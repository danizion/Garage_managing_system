# Garage_managing_system
A garage management system built in c# with the purpose of being easily maintainable  and reusable (code-wise of courseðŸ˜Š)
any addition of a new type of vehicle will require a minimal change to the code.
Letâ€™s say we would like to add a new type of vehicle e.g. adding a spaceship to the garage.
We will simply need to add the spaceship.cs file with all the methods an attributes the spaceship has, make a small change to the vehicle creator class and boooooom weâ€™re done!
